Handwritten Letter Classification with Keras
This project implements a machine learning model for classifying English handwritten letters (A-Z) using the Keras Sequential API. The model is trained on a custom dataset containing images of handwritten English letters and is evaluated based on its ability to correctly predict each letter. The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve high classification accuracy.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying images of handwritten English letters. Using the Keras Sequential API, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to recognize patterns in images and predict the correct letter. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in solving image classification tasks.

The model is trained on a custom handwritten letters dataset and is evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy and a confusion matrix.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Keras (with TensorFlow backend)
NumPy
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn (for evaluation and metrics)
Seaborn (for visualization)
Dataset
The model is trained on a custom dataset of handwritten English letters. The dataset contains images of handwritten letters (A-Z) and their corresponding labels. The images are preprocessed for input into the model, and the labels are used for training and evaluation.

Usage
After setting up the project, you can begin by training the model. The key steps include:

Loading the dataset: The custom dataset is loaded, and images are preprocessed to be suitable for training.
Training the model: The model is trained on the dataset to learn the patterns of handwritten letters.
Evaluating the model: After training, the model is evaluated on a test set to measure its accuracy and performance.
Visualizing the results: A confusion matrix is generated to visualize how well the model performs on each letter class.
The entire process can be run in a Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed.

Model Architecture
The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using Keras' Sequential API. CNNs are particularly effective in image classification tasks because they automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.

The architecture includes:

Convolutional layers: These layers help extract features from the input images (e.g., edges, shapes).
Max pooling layers: These layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the data, improving computation efficiency.
Fully connected layers: These layers help make the final classification decision.
Output layer: The model has an output layer with 26 neurons, one for each letter of the alphabet.
Results
The model achieves an accuracy of around 84% on the test set. This result shows that the model is able to generalize well to new, unseen data. A confusion matrix is also generated to help visualize the model's performance on each individual letter.

Key Metrics:
validation Accuracy: 84%
Test Accuracy: 84%
The confusion matrix reveals the areas where the model performs well and areas where improvements can be made, such as misclassifying certain letters or being more confident in predictions.
